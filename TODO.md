# TODO — streambuffer

Open work items for this repo. Cross-cutting tracking lives in
[`../workspace/crossrepostatus.md`](../workspace/crossrepostatus.md);
items here are streambuffer-specific or are this repo's slice of a
cross-cutting initiative.

**Completed work is not recorded here.** It lives in git history and in
`crossrepostatus.md`; a finished item is deleted from this file rather than
annotated, so everything below is genuinely still open.

## Open

- **Formal verification — follow-ups.** The two-layer setup (OpenJML ESC proof of the static
  sequential core + OpenJML RAC under the full test suite) landed 2026-09 — see CLAUDE.md
  "Formal Verification" and `.github/workflows/formal-verification.yml`. Still open, in priority
  order:
  - **Checker Framework Lock Checker (deferred, not rejected).** Would soundly gate the
    `@GuardedBy("bufferLock")` discipline (Error Prone gates it heuristically today, in the
    default build). Blocked on a real cascade, not effort aversion: CF's JDK stubs for
    `Closeable`, `InputStream` and `OutputStream` declare mutually inconsistent `close()`
    receiver types (`@GuardSatisfied` vs `@GuardedBy`), so any receiver annotation that
    satisfies one stub violates another — plus `toString()`'s `synchronized` block trips
    `synchronized.block.in.lockingfree.method`. Revisit if CF ships consistent stubs, or gate it
    with a curated `-AskipDefs`/stub override.
  - **JPF interleaving harness — follow-ups.** The harness (`src/test/jpf/`, the scheduled
    `jpf-interleavings` job in `formal-verification.yml`) runs. Still open: report the AtomicLong
    model completion upstream as a jpf-core deficiency (its native peer already implements the
    methods the stub model never declared), and possibly a second harness for the array-read /
    `waitForAtLeast` blocking paths (jcstress covers those today; JPF would make them exhaustive).
  - **RAC evaluates a `signals (E e)` clause for an exception of another type — confirmed OpenJML
    bug, reported in [OpenJML/OpenJML#1050](https://github.com/OpenJML/OpenJML/issues/1050)** (2026-10-19; reproduced on 21.0.28 and on `dev-21` `529ac454da`,
    `BUGHUNT-MEASUREMENTS.md`, „OpenJML-Verdachtsfälle (RAC)“, in commit `0620aa7`, removed since). The spec
    of `waitForAtLeast` allows `InterruptedException` (`signals_only IllegalArgumentException,
    InterruptedException`) and constrains only the other one (`signals (IllegalArgumentException e)
    bytes <= 0`). When a read is interrupted, RAC prints `JML undefined exceptional postcondition -
    exception thrown` with `ClassCastException: InterruptedException cannot be cast to
    IllegalArgumentException` (stack at `waitForAnyData`, which calls `waitForAtLeast`). By JML's
    semantics the clause only applies when the exception is an instance of `E`, so nothing should be
    reported. Confirmed: the call-site check casts without an `instanceof` guard when the predicate
    folds to `false` for the actual argument (`waitForAtLeast(1L)`), `JmlAssertionAdder.applyHelper`.
    Harmless here (reported, not thrown, under `rac=exception`; the test stays green). To do: re-run
    once a release carries the fix.
  - **RAC prints a full stack trace per call for an uncompiled model method — confirmed OpenJML
    usability defect, reported in [OpenJML/OpenJML#1050](https://github.com/OpenJML/OpenJML/issues/1050)** (2026-10-19, same issue; 1000 `arraycopy` = 1000 traces, also
    on `dev-21`; compiling with `-quiet` silences it). Every `System.arraycopy` and `clone` under RAC logs
    `Skipping a specification clause because it contains an uncompiled model method: 'boolean
    java.util.Arrays.equalArrays` plus a `NoSuchMethodError` stack trace (about 10 KB), once per
    call rather than once per clause. That is what made the concurrent-trim test take 7,344 s and
    21 GB of log; worked around by scaling the stress loops under `-Pjml-rac`
    (`StreamBufferTest.iterations`) and running jqwik with 100 tries there. Once fixed upstream, the
    scaling can go.
  - **Invariants + non-static inner classes break RAC — confirmed OpenJML bug, reported in
    [OpenJML/OpenJML#1012](https://github.com/OpenJML/OpenJML/issues/1012).** RAC checks the outer class's invariant inside the inner class's constructor and
    reads the field on the inner class → `NoSuchFieldError` at runtime (21.0.27 and 21.0.28).
    **21.0.29: the minimal reproducer below runs clean, the defect on this class does not go away** --
    with the four candidate invariants RAC throws `NoSuchMethodError` on
    `StreamBuffer$SBOutputStream.JML$INV$$<n>()` (the outer invariant check called on the inner
    class), 106 errors (measured 2026-10-20).
    **Narrowed down 2026-10-21 (21.0.29):** the trigger is an inner-class method calling an outer
    instance method *without a qualifier* -- exactly the delegation `SBOutputStream.write(int)` →
    `writeSingleByte(b)` (and `writeFromArray`, `closeAll`, `readSingleByte`, `availableClamped`).
    RAC checks the callee's receiver invariant on `this` (the inner object) instead of
    `StreamBuffer.this`:
    ```java
    public class InvA {
        private long x = 1;
        //@ private invariant 0 <= x;
        void inc() { x++; }
        class Inner { void go() { inc(); } }
        public static void main(String... a) { new InvA().new Inner().go(); }
    }
    ```
    → `NoSuchMethodError: 'boolean InvA$Inner.JML$INV$$107()'`. Same with a `private` outer method.
    Clean: `InvA.this.inc()`, `other.inc()` on another reference, outer → inner calls,
    `synchronized (InvA.this) { x++; }` inside the inner class. To report on
    [OpenJML/OpenJML#1012](https://github.com/OpenJML/OpenJML/issues/1012). Possible downstream
    workaround to try: qualify the delegating calls as `StreamBuffer.this.writeSingleByte(b)`.
    The 21.0.27/21.0.28 reproducer (fixed in 21.0.29):
    ```java
    public class Outer {
        private long x = 1;
        //@ private invariant 0 <= x;
        class Inner { Inner() {} }
        public static void main(String... a) { new Outer().new Inner(); }
    }
    ```
    `openjml --rac` compiles; running it throws `NoSuchFieldError: Class Outer$Inner does not
    have member field 'long x'`. With the four candidate invariants StreamBuffer fails 258/285
    tests. An earlier 21.0.27 compile crash ("no enclosing instance") was not reproduced.
  - **Deeper ESC — instance-method / trim() functional correctness (parked, revisit).** Today
    ESC proves the 14 static helpers; the instance methods and trim() are RAC-only. A full
    functional proof (e.g. a ghost model sequence for the deque with the invariant
    `availableBytes == sum of buffered byte[] lengths`, preserved across read/write/trim) is the
    "TimSort-level" target. Currently blocked two ways: OpenJML ESC returns solver "unknown" on
    instance methods of this class (the non-static inner stream classes poison the receiver
    context), and modelling the deque as a ghost `\seq` is large (the LinkedList/KeY study was
    ~7 person-months for 328 LoC). Not gold-plating in principle — just expensive today; worth a
    re-scoping spike to see whether a *partial* invariant (e.g. non-negativity + position bounds
    proven on a static extraction of the read/write inner loops) is reachable more cheaply.
  - **On every OpenJML upgrade:** re-try the four class invariants documented in the `.jml`
    header (no bundled spec is deleted at install any more since fixups v3, so there is nothing
    to re-try in `.github/actions/setup-openjml/action.yml`), and, once #1050 is fixed, drop the
    RAC scaling (`streambuffer.test.rac` and `jqwik.tries.default` in the `jml-rac` profile,
    `StreamBufferTest.iterations`).
  - **Evaluated and rejected 2026-09** (do not re-open without new facts) — deductive/model-checking
    alternatives beyond OpenJML: **KeY 3.0.0** — could
    re-prove the same static scope with archived `.proof` files, but proof replay is
    version-brittle and adds maintenance without widening the scope (generics unsupported, no
    concurrency, no `Deque`/`java.util.concurrent` stubs); **VerCors 2.4.0** — only candidate
    with concurrent-Java separation logic, but models locks as single-entrant, has no
    volatile/JMM semantics and near-empty JDK stubs: verifying StreamBuffer means re-modeling it,
    a research project; **JBMC (cbmc 6.11)** — its JDK-8 model library has no
    `ArrayDeque`/`java.util.concurrent`, thread support officially limited; would only duplicate
    the ESC scope, bounded; **Infer/RacerD v1.3.0** — explicitly "avoids reasoning about weak
    memory and Java's volatile keyword", i.e. blind to exactly this class's design.

- **jqwik pin policy** — see [`../workspace/policies/jqwik-prompt-injection.md`](../workspace/policies/jqwik-prompt-injection.md). `jqwik.version ≤ 1.9.3` is mandatory. A standing constraint, not a task: it has to be re-checked whenever the dependency is bumped.

- **`@VisibleForTesting` audit.** `StreamBuffer` has **15** package-private methods that exist so tests can reach them (`decideTrimExecution`, `shouldTrim`, `clampToMaxInt`, `decrementAvailableBytesBudget`, `calculateResultingChunks`, the five `shouldSkipTrim*`/`should*` predicates, `isAvailableBytesPositive`, `isMaxAllocSizeLessThanAvailable`, `shouldCheckEdgeCase`, `recordReadStatistics`, `shouldUpdateMaxObservedBytes`, `updateMaxObservedBytesIfNeeded`). None is annotated, and Guava is not a dependency here — so closing this means deciding between (a) adding a project-local marker annotation, which puts a new public type into the API surface of a deliberately one-class library, and (b) recording that the convention does not apply to this repo. Decide and act; do not leave it as a permanently open audit.

- **Null-safety refinement.** JSpecify + NullAway are enforced at compile time in **strict JSpecify mode** with the extra options `CheckOptionalEmptiness`, `AcknowledgeRestrictiveAnnotations`, `AcknowledgeAndroidRecent`, `AssertsEnabled` (see `pom.xml`); the package carries an explicit `@NullMarked` via `package-info.java`. The production code has no `@Nullable` markers because every value is non-null by construction (constructors reject `null`, no `return null` sites). Open follow-up: as new public API surfaces are added, evaluate whether `@Nullable` or `Optional<T>` would be more precise than the implicit non-null default.

- **Cross-repo code-quality TODOs** — see [`../workspace/policies/code-quality-todos.md`](../workspace/policies/code-quality-todos.md) for the canonical `@VisibleForTesting` design-fit review, package hierarchy review, and class/method naming review. This module is single-package, so the package review is trivially satisfied; the naming review is still open.
